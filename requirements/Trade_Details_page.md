Let's modify the Trade History page to show the trades from database. Layout should look like as an attached image but match the styles as per our theme.

Keep in mind the following:
1 - Bulk Action will contain action such as "Delete" if multiple Trades are selected.
2 -  Clicking on a single Trade should take the user to the Trade Details Page.
